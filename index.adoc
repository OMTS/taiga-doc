[[introduction]]
Introduction
------------

Free. Open Source. Powerful. _Taiga_ is a project management platform for startups
and agile developers & designers who want a simple, beautiful tool that makes work
truly enjoyable.


[[how-it-works]]
How it Works
------------

_Taiga_ is made up of two components: link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front[taiga-front]
and link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back[taiga-back]

- *taiga-front* has the frontend related code built with *angularjs* and *coffeescript*.
  It can run on any static file server like nginx.
- *taiga-back* has the backend related code consisting of an API, built using *django*
  and *python3*.

_Taiga_ has some other modules, but they are optional and documented in other sections.


[[requirements]]
Requirements
------------

This is a list of major _Taiga_ dependencies:

Runtime:

- Python >= 3.4
- PostgreSQL >= 9.3
- RabbitMQ (optional as long as you don't want async notifications)

Compile time:

- GCC & Development Headers
- Ruby >= 2.1 (only for compiling sass)
- NodeJS >= 5.0 (with npm and gulp for downloading dependencies and compiling coffeescript)

Hardware

- The main Taiga hardware restriction is having **at least 0.75 GB of RAM**. When installing
the python requirements, the package lxml will use gcc to build itself and fail if there
is not enough memory.
- Taiga code doesn't need a lot of disc space. Only the database or the media directory might need
more space with the passage of time.

[[how-to-contribute]]
How to Contribute

Examples of contributions include:

- link:#reporting-bugs[Bug reports]
- Code patches
- Improvements
- Patch reviews
- link:#translate[Translate]

Before starting to develop a big feature (intended to be included on the _Taiga_ code base), it is
strongly recommended that you reach out to us on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].


[[reporting-bugs]]
Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

- Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by searching, or running custom
  queries in, the link:https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues[issue tracker].
- Check the right repository to use for reporting an issue: bugs related to UI should go to *taiga-front*,
  but if something is broken on the backend, an issue should be opened on the *taiga-back* repository.
- Ask on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] first if you're not sure if
  what you're seeing is a bug.
- Don't use the GitHub issues system to ask support questions. Use the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] for that.
- Donâ€™t use GitHub issues for lengthy discussions, because they're likely to get lost. If a particular
  ticket is controversial, please move the discussion to the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].

documentation and repository. The currently supported plugins are:

* link:http://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-github-auth[taiga-github-auth]: GitHub Auth plugin

* link:http://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-slack[taiga-contrib-slack]: Slack integration plugin


[[themes]]
Themes
-------

You can create custom themes in Taiga.

To create a theme you have to create a new folder in `/app/themes/` with your theme name, or duplicate a
 previous one. If you create a new folder, then create two files inside.

* `variables.scss` - to override sass variables, fonts, mixins helpers..etc.

* `custom.scss` - to override any defined Taiga style for any module or layout.

Remember, the file `variables.scss` should only contain sass declarations that do not generate code by
 themselves (like variables or mixins).

If you need to override a style and generate some new CSS, you should do it in `custom.scss`.

Please, check the default Taiga theme to understand how these files work properly.

When the files are created you have to run gulp with the theme name. This is the same as `gulp default` but
 uses your theme instead of the default taiga theme.

[source]
----
gulp --theme themeName
----

If you want to compile all themes you should run.

[source]
----
gulp compile-themes
